//
// All language files should use UTF-8 as their encoding and the files must not contain a BOM.
//
// Placeholders can now contain order information, e.g. instead of
// 'Page %s of %s' you can (and should) write 'Page %1$s of %2$s', this allows
// translators to re-order the output of data while ensuring it remains correct
//
// You do not need this where single placeholders are used, e.g. 'Message %d' is fine
// equally where a string contains only two placeholders which are used to wrap text
// in a url you again do not need to specify an order e.g., 'Click %sHERE%s' is fine

*    Installation File How-to
*
*    Below are the parameters that must be set for a game to be installed into
*    the arcade.  There is no current way (and there will probably not be one)
*    to manually install games from the ACP.
*
*    You need this file for the game to show up in the ACP to install.
*
*    The only items that need to be set are the games name, description,
*    width, height, type, scoretype and files.
*
*	 The arcade supports 7 types of games. (Activity Mod, IBPro, IBPro arcadelib,
*	 V3Arcade, IBProV3, Arcade room and games that do not submit scores)
*	 Use the following constants for the type:
*
*	 AMOD_GAME
*	 AR_GAME
*	 IBPRO_GAME
*	 IBPRO_ARCADELIB_GAME
*	 V3ARCADE_GAME
*	 IBPROV3_GAME
*	 NOSCORE_GAME
*
*    The scoretype should either be SCORETYPE_HIGH or SCORETYPE_LOW
*    these constants are defined in the main arcade class already.
*    SCORETYPE_HIGH is for games that score so that the best score is
*    the highest.  SCORETYPE_LOW is for games that score so that the
*    best score is the lowest.
*
*    The game_files item contains an array of any extra files and/or directories
*    that are need for the game to run that are not in the same folder as the main
*    game.  They should be listed without the path from the phpbb root.
*
*    The following example would be if the game required three( 3) files:
*
*    \'game_files\'        => array (
*        0    => \'arcade/gamedata/snake/scores.swf\',
*        1    => \'arcade/games/snake/scores.swf\',
*        2    => \'arcade/gamedata/games/snake/scores.swf\',
*    )
*
*    If there are no extra files the item should be set to false:
